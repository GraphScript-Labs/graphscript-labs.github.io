## What is GraphScript?

**GraphScript** is a **flow-based visual scripting language** that lets you create logic using connected blocks and nodes â€” like building code with a visual graph.

It's designed to be:

- **Intuitive** for beginners  
- **Flexible** for advanced users  
- Ideal for **prototyping**, **logic visualization**, and **interactive systems**

GraphScript aims to make programming **more visual**, **modular**, and **accessible**.
